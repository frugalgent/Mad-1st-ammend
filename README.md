# Maddison's 1st Ammendment Calculator

This project's goal is to present what it would look like if the original first ammendment that maddison proposed would have been ratified. What would the House of Representatives look like in this alternate universe?

I have taken the most recent census data, imported it and processed it state by state based on the formula Maddison provided to determine how many representatives each state would have today.

Please share and if you see any errors or improvements feel free to contribute.
